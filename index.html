            <p>
                I'm a pretty chill person most of the time, but ask me about things related to video games
                and anime and I will be on that topic for days. I'm good at keeping these things to myself until I know
                that the other person has the same interests as me. These things have become major parts in my life and
                because of that, I would always have the urge to create. Digital drawing is another hobby I like to do to pass
                the time.
